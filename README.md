# Analyzing-Phishing-Emails
I am going to go through a demo of the different parts of an email and how to analyze if it is malicious or not

First we will define what phishing is.
Phishing is a type of social engineering where an attacker sends a fraudulent message designed to trick a person into revealing sensitive information to the attacker
There are different types of phishing we are going to cover the main topic of phishing.

First steps to analyze an email header if it is suspicous
1. The sender's email address
2. The subject line
3. The date the email was sent
4. The recipients email address

We can see in this email I have recieved it is clearly phishing but let's try to prove that it is.
